Installation
To download this package into your laravel project, use the command-line to execute the following command

composer require crestapps/laravel-code-generator --dev
(You may skip this step when using Laravel >= 5.5) To bootstrap the packages into your project while using command-line only, open the app/Providers/AppServiceProvider.php file in your project. Then, add the following code to the register() method.

Add the following line to bootstrap laravel-code-generator to the framework.

if ($this->app->runningInConsole()) {
    $this->app->register('CrestApps\CodeGenerator\CodeGeneratorServiceProvider');
}
A layout is required for the default views! The code generator allows you to create a layout using the command-line. Of cource you can use your own layout. You'll only need to include CSS bootstrap framework in your layout for the default templates to work properly. Additionally, you can chose to you design your own templetes using a different or no css framework.

Examples
The following example assumes that we are trying to create a CRUD called AssetCategory with the fields listed below.

id
name
description
is_active
Basic example - CRUD with migration
php artisan resource-file:create AssetCategory --fields=id,name,description,is_active

The above command will create resource-file names /resources/laravel-code-generator/sources/asset_categories.json

php artisan create:scaffold AssetCategory --with-migration

The above command will create a model app/Models/AssetCategory, a controller app/Http/Controllers/AssetCategoriesController, all views, the routes, and migration class!

Basic example - CRUD with migration - Shortcut
php artisan create:scaffold AssetCategory --with-migration --fields=id,name,description,is_active

The above command will create resource-file names /resources/laravel-code-generator/sources/asset_categories.json first. Then, it will create a model app/Models/AssetCategory, a controller app/Http/Controllers/AssetCategoriesController, all views, the routes, and migration class!. This is a short way to issuing both `resource-file:create` and `create:scaffold` in one line

Basic API example - CRUD with migration
php artisan resource-file:create AssetCategory --fields=id,name,description,is_active

The above command will create resource-file names /resources/laravel-code-generator/sources/asset_categories.json

php artisan create:scaffold AssetCategory --with-migration

The above command will create a model app/Models/AssetCategory, a controller app/Http/Controllers/AssetCategoriesController, all views, the routes, and migration class!

Basic example using translations for English and Arabic - with migration
php artisan resource-file:create AssetCategory --fields=id,name,description,is_active --translation-for=en,ar

The above command will create resource-file names /resources/laravel-code-generator/sources/asset_categories.json

php artisan create:scaffold AssetCategory --with-migration

The above command will create a model app/Models/AssetCategory, a controller app/Http/Controllers/AssetCategoriesController, all views, the routes, and migration class!

Basic example with form-request
php artisan resource-file:create AssetCategory --fields=id,name,description,is_active

The above command will create resource-file names /resources/laravel-code-generator/sources/asset_categories.json

php artisan create:scaffold AssetCategory --with-form-request

The above command will create a model app/Models/AssetCategory, a controller app/Http/Controllers/AssetCategoriesController, all views, the routes, and app/Http/Requests/AssetCategoriesFormRequest class!

Basic example with soft-delete and migration
php artisan resource-file:create AssetCategory --fields=id,name,description,is_active

The above command will create resource-file names /resources/laravel-code-generator/sources/asset_categories.json

php artisan create:scaffold AssetCategory --with-soft-delete --with-migration

The above command will create a model app/Models/AssetCategory, a controller app/Http/Controllers/AssetCategoriesController, all views, the routes, and migration file!

Creating resources from existing database
php artisan create:scaffold AssetCategory --table-exists

The above command will create resource-file names /resources/laravel-code-generator/sources/asset_categories.json. It is going to assume that the table name is called "asset_categories" in your database. If that is not the case, you can use --table-name=some_other_table_name

Then it will create a model app/Models/AssetCategory, a controller app/Http/Controllers/AssetCategoriesController, all views and the routes!

You may also create a resource-file from existing database separately using php artisan resource-file:from-database AssetCategory

Creating resources from existing database with translation for English and Arabic
php artisan create:scaffold AssetCategory --translation-for=en,ar --table-exists

The above command will create resource-file names /resources/laravel-code-generator/sources/asset_categories.json

Then it will create a model app/Models/AssetCategory, a controller app/Http/Controllers/AssetCategoriesController, all views and the routes!

You may also create a resource-file from existing database separately using php artisan resource-file:from-database AssetCategory --translation-for=en,ar

Creating resources from existing database with translation for English and Arabic in two step for better control over the fields!
php artisan resource-file:from-database AssetCategory --translation-for=en,ar

php artisan create:scaffold AssetCategory

The above command will create resource-file names /resources/laravel-code-generator/sources/asset_categories.json

Then it will create a model app/Models/AssetCategory, a controller app/Http/Controllers/AssetCategoriesController, all views and the routes!
